            <i>"Dogs, known for their loyal and social nature, thrive in environments that allow them to interact with
                fellow furry companions. Dog playdates, organised gatherings where dogs can engage in social activities,
                offer a plethora of advantages for both the dogs and their owners. Here, we explore the benefits of
                incorporating regular playdates into your canine's routine." </i>

                <img src="images/images/AdobeStock_481854589.jpeg" alt="pet family">
                <p>Dogs are inherently social animals, and playdates provide invaluable opportunities for them to refine
                    their social skills. Regular interaction with other dogs helps reduce the risk of behavioural
                    issues, fostering a well-rounded and sociable pet.

                <img src="images/images/AdobeStock_277739918.jpeg" alt="dogs in the garden">
                <p>Engaging in playful activities during dog playdates ensures that your furry friend gets the physical
                    exercise essential for maintaining overall health. Regular exercise contributes to weight management
                    and cardiovascular well-being. </p>

                <img src="images/Stock-Photos/AdobeStock_203102046.jpeg" alt="dogs in the garden">
                <p>Interacting with their canine counterparts during playdates stimulates dogs mentally. This mental
                    enrichment is crucial for preventing boredom and promoting cognitive health.

                <img src="images/Stock-Photos/AdobeStock_114647146.jpeg" alt="dogs and family">
                <p>Dogs learn from each other, especially during play. Playdates can positively influence behaviour,
                    teaching valuable lessons in sharing, communication, and problem-solving. </p>

                <img src="images/Stock-Photos/AdobeStock_399743533.jpeg" alt="dogs in the garden">
                <p>Just as in humans, stress is a concern for dogs. Playdates offer a stress-free environment where dogs
                    can relax, socialise, and engage in activities that contribute to lower anxiety levels. </p>

                <p>Dog playdates not only benefit the dogs but also provide an opportunity for owners to connect, share
                    experiences, and build a sense of community. The shared joy of watching furry friends play fosters
                    camaraderie among dog owners. </p>

                <p>Owners can use playdates to observe their dog's play style and interactions. This insight helps
                    identify any potential issues, preferences, or adjustments needed in the play environment. </p>

                <p>Energetic breeds, in particular, benefit from playdates as they offer a controlled space for

                <h3>Dental Care</h3>
                <p>Equipped with a dedicated dental x-ray unit, we are able to diagnose painful problems in your pet’s
                    mouth that would otherwise be missed. Dental radiographs help us to determine whether teeth might be
                    abnormal, missing, non-vital or malpositioned and able us to perform a thorough assessment of the
                    teeth and surrounding soft tissues. Our clinics have modern dental equipment available and our
                    veterinary surgeons regularly perform nerve blocks to ensure your pet stays comfortable. Using this
                    equipment we can perform prophylactic clean/scale/polishes, as well as extractions and more involved
                    oral surgery.</p>

                <h3>Surgical Services</h3>
                <p>Cairnville Veterinary Clinic has an extensive range of surgical facilities allowing us to treat a
                    range of problems in-house without the need for referral. We use modern equipment, anaesthetics and
                    pain management to ensure that your pet’s procedure is as safe and comfortable as possible. We offer
                    orthopaedic, soft tissue, desexing, ophthalmic, and emergency surgical services, amongst others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-card">
                <h3>Anaesthesia</h3>
                <p>At Cairnville Veterinary Clinic we offer the best and safest options available to minimise any risk
                    whilst your pet is under anaesthetic. Your pet’s age, breed, health and anaesthetic history will
                    determine what choice of anaesthetic we select.

                    All pets are monitored carefully whilst under anaesthetic and during recovery. Our experienced
                    veterinary nurses monitor your pet closely and combined with our extensive anaesthetic monitoring
                    equipment this ensures that your pet experiences the best anaesthetic possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-card">
                <h3>I/V Fluid Therapy</h3>
                <p>As a standard, all animals undergoing general anaesthesia will be placed on intravenous fluids for
                    the duration of their procedure. Anaesthetics reduce circulation to vital organs which can result in
                    permanent damage. Administering Intravenous fluids during anaesthesia helps to maintain blood
                    pressure and supports the blood flow to vital organs. Administering Intravenous fluids also makes
                    the procedure safer and speeds up recovery from anaesthesia. Having a catheter in place also ensures
                    that in the event of an emergency, our veterinarians have immediate access to your pet’s bloodstream
                    ensuring emergency medications can be given rapidly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-card">
                <h3>Microchipping</h3>
                <p>Our modern, pet-specific x-ray machine, combined with the latest digital x-ray technology gives us
                    clearer x-rays in a shorter timeframe than ever before. Combined with a physical examination and
                    your pet’s history, radiographs are used to assist our veterinarians in diagnosing and treating your
                    pet. Cairnville Veterinary Clinic has an arrangement with overseas radiography specialists to
                    organise rapid, specialist second opinions on x-rays if required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-card">
                <h3>Orthopaedic Surgery</h3>
                <p>Orthopaedic surgery involves any surgery that is related to bones or joints. Our extensive range of
                    surgical facilities and veterinarian expertise allows us to perform many orthopaedic surgical
