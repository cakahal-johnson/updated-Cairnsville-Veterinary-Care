                    <p>Our pets play multiple, varied and important roles in our lives. They are companions for
                        relaxation, for physical activity or for teaching our children responsibility. They provide
                        humour, fun and a sense of purpose. As assistance animals they help visually impaired people
                        maintain independent, fulfilling lives and assist the ill and elderly manage anxiety and pain.
                        Companion animals also play an important role in treatment of mental health, particularly for
                        returned soldiers and first responders. Assistance dogs provide support and help to rebuild
                        trust and connections with family and the wider community. <a target="_blank"

                    <p>Responsible pet ownership means making choices that help you and your companion animal (pet) have
                        a safe and happy life. Desexing is a very important part of this and it is crucial to understand
                        the role that desexing plays for the health, safety and protection of your companion animal.
                        <br> Desexing animals not only helps to prevent unwanted pregnancies – meaning fewer unwanted
                        animals - but also research shows that desexed animals can actually live longer and healthier
                        lives. Desexing can reduce the risk of certain diseases and behavioural issues, benefiting your
                        animal’s health and welfare. <a target="_blank"

                    <p>Now that summer is here and the temperatures are climbing in many parts of the country, it’s
                        important to protect your dog from the heat, as exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat
                        exhaustion and life threatening heatstroke. <br> Like in humans, heatstroke occurs when an
                        animal’s body temperature becomes elevated above the normal range due to exposure to excessively
                        high temperatures, to the point where their body’s temperature-regulating mechanism fails and
                        they can’t maintain a healthy temperature. It’s a very serious condition that can cause organ
                        failure or death. Some animals are at higher risk of overheating and severe consequences such
